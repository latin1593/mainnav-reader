Based on 'Mainnav MD-950d serial port log' by SÃ¶nke J. Peters:

Serial port parameters: 115200/8-N-1


Task: Request device status and log size.
Send: '$3\r\n'
Receive:'$OK!\r\n\x00\x00\x20\x60'
Further explanation: last 4 bytes is the size of all tracklogs (big endian).


Task: Delete all tracklogs from the device.
Send: '$2\r\n'
Receive:'$OK!\r\n'
When the deletion process is completed, the device sends out '$FINISH\r\n'.


Task: Download all tracklogs
Send: '$1\r\n' (switch to download mode)
Receive: '$OK!\r\n'
Send: '\x15' (request a chunk)
Receive: ... (the first chunk)
Send: '\x15' (request a chunk)
Receive: ... (the second chunk)
Send: '\x15' (request a chunk)
Receive: ... (the third chunk)
[...]
Send: '\x15' (request a chunk)
Receive: '\x04$FINISH\r\n' (there are no more chunks, \x04 means EOT)

Note: Sending '\x06' increases/decreases the per chunk up/down-counter.
      Sending '\x15' do NOT increases/decreases the per chunk up/down-counter.
      But it does not affect the actual data being sent by the device, it's
      always the next chunk, so I don't know for what this is for.
      You must start downloading with '\x15'.


Task: Abort a running transmission
Send: '$1\r\n' (switch to download mode)
Receive: '$OK!\r\n'
Send: '\x15' (request a chunk)
Receive: ... (the first chunk)
Send '\x18' (abort it)
Receive: '\x06\x06\x06\x06' (device is now back in standard mode)
