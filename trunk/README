mainnav-reader - version 0.1 - readme

This tiny tool reads out and deletes tracklog data from mainnav gps devices
under linux. It can speak to your device either via USB or Bluetooth.
Note: mainnav-reader needs pySerial (python-serial on some distros) to run.

To Install, download the latest version, extract the archive and run as root:

 * python setup.py install

Afterwards you, can run the program via the command-line by typing in:

 * mainnav-reader

I suggest you start with:

 * mainnav-reader --help

To test the connection, you can type in:

 * mainnav-reader --verbose /dev/ttyUSB0
  Or, if the GPS device is connected via Bluetooth (Note: Be sure you have a
  connection to the serial-port prepared):
 * mainnav-reader --verbose /dev/rfcomm0

The simplest way to download the tracklogs is:

 * mainnav-reader --download /dev/ttyUSB0
  Or for short:
 * mainnav-reader -d /dev/ttyUSB0
